  Our project is a data generator and stat predictor for NBA sports betting. 
  We developed three algorithms: a Neural Network, a Linear Regression model, 
  and various Averages. We combined these three models and our data processing 
  into a Textual User Interface (TUI) that people can use to run all three
  models on various players and stats to get insights, model params, and/or 
  model outputs.
