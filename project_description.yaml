  This will be a bot that is capable of placing various wagers on different 
  sports, primarily basketball. We will develop statistical 
  analysis techniques that involve scraping data from online sources to 
  determine whether or not a player will score above or below a certain line. 
  Our main types of bets will be player lines as opposed to determining whether 
  or not a certain team will win or lose a game.
