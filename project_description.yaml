  This will be a bot that is capable of making predictions for player over-unders
  for NBA basketball. We will develop three algorithms: a Neural Network, a
  Linear Regression model, and Exponential Moving Averages. We will combine
  these three models into a Textual User Interface (TUI) that users can use
  run all three models on players over-unders of their choice.
